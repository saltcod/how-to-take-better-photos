		<div class="col8 margin1 pad2x">
			<p>There's jargon everywhere you turn. The internet is crammed with it to the point that nothing makes sense anymore, and the sales people at the local camera store are intimidating.</p>
			<p>The primary goal of this is to help you wade through all the sales-speak and technical nonsense that you don't care about, and focus on taking nice photos of your kids or your cats or whatever you're taking photos of.</p>

			<p>F-stops, shutterspeed, ISO, and all those other settings on your camera are important &#8212; I'm not suggesting that you not use any of these things&#8212;but I am telling you that none of it needs to be complicated. </p>
			
			<blockquote class="huge">It's not rocket science</blockquote>

			<p> If you're taking photos now and find them boring or uninspiring, or just want to get closer to some of the great photos you see online, there are a couple of dead-simple techniques you can use to get there.</p>

			<p><strong>Fair warning:</strong> all that follows is my own opinion, gained from years of shooting. Other photographers will have very different opinions about what you should know or what is most important.Your uncle might think that the ISO is important (and he's right!), or your sister might try and convince you that shutter speed is most important (and she's right too!), but I strongly feel that there's one single secret that separates a great photo from an uninspired one. In fact, it's the subject of the next section. </p>

			<p>Let's get started, shall we?</p>

		<div class="col8 margin1 pad2x">
			<p>That's right. <em>The</em> secret.There's just one. The enormous and complicated field of photography is all about one, single secret. Chances are, if you're still unhappy about the photos you're taking with your brand new camera, you haven't discovered this secret yet. You've no doubt heard the word, but maybe no one has impressed on you how important it is. Today's your big day!</p>

			<p><em>And the secret is:</em></p>
			<p><em>Drumroll</em></p>
			
			<h2>Aperture</h2>
			
			<p>The one and only thing separating you from better photos of your kids and cats is aperture. That's it. Although your camera has a pile of other settings, <em>this</em> is the one that you should focus your attention on.</p>

			<h2>What is Aperture?</h2>
			I said up front that this isn't a technical article, and I'm sticking to it! I don't want to get bogged down in the technical aspects of what aperture is &#8212; you can read all about that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture">somewhere else</a> if you're interesed. I want to focus on what impact aperture has on your photos. And again, it's my opinion that you don't need to know the technical stuff going on the background to see what aperture can do for you.

			<h2>An Aperture exercise</h2>
			<p>I want you to forget about the word aperture for a second. Instead, follow along here with your finger:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hold your finger about one foot from your nose.</li>
				<li>Stare at your finger.</li>
				<li>Next, stare at the floor, or a distant wall or window</li>
				<li>Keep alternating focus between your finger and the wall.</li>
				<li>Finger</li>
				<li>Wall</li>
				<li>Finger</li>
				<li>Wall</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>While you're altertaning between focusing on your finger and the wall, just have a look at what happens to the item that you're not focused on. What happens to the wall when you're staring at the finger? It becomes blurry, doesn't it? As a result, your finger becomes more prominent in the scene </p>


			<h2>What can aperture do for me?</h2>
			Aperture is what transforms a normal photo into a great one. When you're shooting photos of people, it's always, always, always going to be aperture that will separate good photos from boring ones.
